## About Me

I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics student at the **University of Toronto** with experience building **production-grade backend systems**, **AI-driven tools**, and **full-stack applications**.

I enjoy working close to the system layer — APIs, data models, infrastructure — and care deeply about writing clean, maintainable software that scales beyond demos.
